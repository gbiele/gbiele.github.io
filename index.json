It remains unclear if deficits in different domains are equally strong in early childhood, and which deficits are specific to ADHD. Here, we describe functional domains in preschoolers and assess deficits in children with ADHD problems, by comparing them to preschoolers with other mental health problems or who develop typically. The ADHD Study assessed 1195 ca. 3.5 years old preschoolers through a semi-structured parent interview, parent questionnaires, and with neuropsychological tests. We determined functional domains by applying factor analytic methods to a broad set of questionnaire- and test-scales. Using resulting factor scores, we employed a Bayesian hierarchical regression to estimate functional deficits in children with ADHD. We found that preschoolerstextbackslashtextquoteright functioning could be described along the seven relatively independent dimensions activity level and regulation, executive function, cognition, language, emotion regulation, introversion, and sociability. Compared to typically developing preschoolers, those with ADHD had deficits in all domains except introversion and sociability. Only deficits in activity level regulation and executive functions were larger than 0.5 standardised mean deviations and larger than deficits of children with other mental health problems. Preschoolers with ADHD have deficits in multiple functional domains, but only impairments in activity level and regulation and executive functions are specific for ADHD and large enough to be clinically significant. Research on functioning in these domains will be important for understanding the development of ADHD, and for improving treatment and prevention approaches.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo project-specific fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below.Regional Committees for Medical Research Ethics - South East Norway https.//rekportalen.no/All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder. Effective long-term treatment options are limited, which warrants increased focus on potential modifiable risk factors. The aim of this study was to investigate associations between maternal diet quality during pregnancy and child diet quality and child ADHD symptoms and ADHD diagnosis. Methods. This study is based on the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). We assessed maternal diet quality with the Prenatal Diet Quality Index (PDQI) and Ultra-Processed Food Index (UPFI) around mid-gestation, and child diet quality using the Diet Quality Index (CDQI) at 3 years. ADHD symptoms were assessed at child age 8 years using the Parent Rating Scale for Disruptive Behaviour Disorders. ADHD diagnoses were retrieved from the Norwegian Patient Registry. Results. In total, 77,768 mother-child pairs were eligible for studying ADHD diagnoses and 37,787 for ADHD symptoms. Means (SD) for the PDQI, UPFI and CDQI were 83.1 (9.3), 31.8 (9.7) and 60.3 (10.6), respectively. Mean (SD) ADHD symptom score was 8.4 (7.1) and ADHD diagnosis prevalence was 2.9% (male to female ratio 2.6.1). For one SD increase in maternal diet index scores, we saw a change in mean (percent) ADHD symptom score of − 0.28 (− 3.3%) (CI. − 0.41, − 0.14 (− 4.8, − 1.6%)) for PDQI scores and 0.25 (+ 3.0%) (CI. 0.13, 0.38 (1.5, 4.5%)) for UPFI scores. A one SD increase in PDQI score was associated with a relative risk of ADHD diagnosis of 0.87 (CI. 0.79, 0.97). We found no reliable associations with either outcomes for the CDQI, and no reliable change in risk of ADHD diagnosis for the UPFI. Conclusions. We provide evidence that overall maternal diet quality during pregnancy is associated with a small decrease in ADHD symptom score at 8 years and lower risk for ADHD diagnosis, with more robust findings for the latter outcome. Consumption of ultra-processed foods was only associated with increased ADHD symptom score of similar magnitude as for overall maternal diet quality, and we found no associations between child diet quality and either outcome. No causal inferences should be made based on these results, due to potential unmeasured confounding.","tags":["Epidemiology","ADHD","RiskFactors"],"title":"The associations between maternal and child diet quality and child ADHD -- findings from a large Norwegian pregnancy cohort study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guido Biele","Ratib Lekhal","Kristin R Overgaard","Mari Vaage Wang","Ragnhild Eek Brandlistuen","Svein Friis","Paal Zeiner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614556800,"objectID":"dae4bff99deb05de5314514819e0441d","permalink":"/publication/pub_2021c/","publishdate":"2021-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pub_2021c/","section":"publication","summary":"Three to seven percent of pre-schoolers have developmental problems or child psychiatric disorders. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicate that interventions in early childhood education and care improve long-term outcomes of children from disadvantaged backgrounds. It is unknown if effects generalize beyond the well-structured context of RCTs and to children who may not have a disadvantaged background but have developmental problems or psychiatric disorders. We use data from the population-based Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study, recruiting pregnant women from 1999 to 2008, with child follow-up from ages 6, 18, and 36 months to ages 5, 7, and 8 years. This sub-study included 2499 children with developmental problems or psychiatric disorders at age five. We investigate the effects of special educational assistance at age five on mother-reported internalizing, externalizing, and communication problems at age eight. We analyse bias due to treatment by indication with directed acyclic graphs, adjust for treatment predictors to reduce bias, and estimate effects in different patient groups and outcome domains with a hierarchical Bayesian model. In the adjusted analysis, pre-schoolers with special educational assistance had on average by 0.1 (0.03-0.16) standardised mean deviation weaker psycho-social difficulties in elementary school. Mean effect sizes varied between groups and outcomes. We estimate positive effects of educational assistance during the transition from preschool to the school years. It should therefore be considered as an intervention for pre-schoolers with developmental or behaviour problems. More research with improved measurements of treatment and outcomes is needed to identify success factors for their implementation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWe received funding from ADHD Research Network in Norway. https.//oslo-universitetssykehus.no/fag-og-forskning/nasjonale-og-regionale-tjenester/nevsom/adhd-forskningsnettverk Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below.Regional Committees for Medical Research Ethics - South East Norway https.//rekportalen.no/All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Estimating causal effects from observational data is hard, some would say rarely possible at all. To still make progress, this project uses large data sets from national registries and approaches including structural models and Bayesian estimation of structural models.\nHere is my related research about selection bias and estimation of causal effects with observational data1.\nSome background\nMost children with ADHD have minor or severe reading and writing problems already in the third grade. A substantial proportion of children and youth receive special educational assistance and/or ADHD medication. This begs the question: Do medication and special educational assistance improve school performance? This question is important, because the few papers that looked at long-term effects of medication find only very small effects, and we know even less about the long-term effects of special educational assistance.\n  Special education, ADHD medication and early reading difficulties in Norway. Special education and the use of ADHD medication increase with child age and are more prevalent among boys. Third graders with ADHD have 10 times more likely severe reading difficulties than those without ADHD.   Some methods\nThis project uses data from Norwegian national registries and the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) to estimate the effects of medication and special education on school performance of children with ADHD or other mental health or developmental problems.\nUsing observational data to estimate treatment effects is difficult (some would say impossible), because individuals are not randomized into treatment conditions. We are still doing this project for two reasons. First, we are interested in effects of longer-term treatments, but conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is considered unethical if one wants to estimate long-term effects of treatments that one assumes should be beneficial. Secondly, well designed placebo controlled randomized trials have the strongest internal validity\u0026ndash;if we see outcome differences between treatment conditions those are due to the treatment, but they still can have a sub-optimal external validity, i.e. we remain uncertain if the treatment effect generalizes to treatment that is not implemented in the context of an RCT. Reasons for a limited external validity include less formalized implementation of treatments outside RCTs or non-random selection of participants into the RCTs. Therefore, carefully implemented observational studies can be a useful complement to RCTs.\nOur approach to a careful implementation of an observational study is to formulate and check a structural model that describes the assumed data-generating process, and to use Bayesian estimation of hierarchical models to obtain estimates of causal effects. Here is an article in which we implemented such an approach.\n  Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of design and causal assumptions (a) School performance at time t2 (SPt2, results of national tests in grades 8 and 9) depends on medication (MED), individual special education (ISE), and on confounders like earlier school performance (SPt1, national tests grade 5), parental education (EDU), and comorbid disorders (COM). Additional potential confounders like gender or parental mental health are omitted here for clarity. (b) Bias from observed confounders (here SPt1, which predicts exposure MED and outcome SPt2) can be controlled by adjusting for them. (c) When SPt1 is a collider between UPA (unobserved parental attention) and USC (unobserved school quality), adjustment for SPt1 leads to conditioning on a collider and cannot correct bias. Instead, inverse probability of treatment weights need to be used.   Data\nWe are starting with a base population of around 600,000 children in Norway that were born between 2000 and 2100. The study population consists of children with ADHD or other mental health or developmental problems (up to maybe 60,000), and these children\u0026rsquo;s parents and siblings. Parents and siblings are an important part of children\u0026rsquo;s environment, which has an influence on school performance generally, and which can also influence how effective treatments are implemented. Special education data is only available from MoBa, so that sample sizes will be smaller for these analyses.\n   Age 0 5 6,7 8 10 (t1) 11-14 15 (t1)     Diagnoses NPR NPR NPR NPR NPR NPR NPR   ADHD symptoms  MoBa  MoBa      Therapy NPR, KUHR NPR, KUHR NPR, KUHR NPR, KUHR NPR, KUHR NPR, KUHR NPR, KUHR   Medication NorPD NorPD NorPD NorPD NorPD NorPD NorPD   Special education  MoBa  MoBa  MoBa    School perform.

SSB: Statistics Norwy  Pilot analyses\nTo check the general feasibility of the project I did some pilot analyses with data from MoBa, NPR, and NorPD (N ~ 1,500 children with ADHD). I used a hierarchical Bayesian ordered logistic regressions to estimate the effect of special education in kindergarten or ADHD medication on reading problems in the 3rd grade. I used inverse probability of treatment weights to adjust for confounding by indication. This analysis shows that on average treatment reduces difficulties, but that also show that effect sizes vary substantially between sub-groups characterised by maternal education and child gender.\n  Pilot analysis results Top left: Effect estimates for ADHD medication. Top right: Effect estimates for special education. Bottom left: Bivariate distribution of medication years and dosage for 10-12 year old children. Darker shading indicates more frequent combinations. Bottom right: More hours special education per week are associated with fewer reading problems. Shaded areas show 25-95% credible intervals.   Working packages\nWP0 provides input for and guides working packages that implement the research and also organizes acquisition of registry data and communication with users. WP1-WP3 follow a similar approach: Treatment patterns and predictors are identified in a first step, based on which effects are estimated in a second step. WP1 focuses on medication and uses data from Norway and Sweden. WP2 focuses on special education. WP3 focuses on interaction effects of special education and medication.\n  Working packages and their dependencies   Collaborators\nThe project will be implemented in collaboration with colleagues in Norway, Sweden, and the UK.\n Jon Michael Gran (University of Oslo) Mari Vaage Wang (NIPH, Oslo) Øystein Karlstad (NIPH, Oslo) Christian Wendelborg (NTNU, Trondheim) Henrik Larsson (Karolinska Institiute, Stockholm) Reinie Cordier (Northumbria University, Newcastle) Mats Fredrirksen (Sykehuset i Vestfold) Nina Holmen (ADHD Norge)    This paper does not address one issue that complicates Bayesian estimation of structural models: In some circumstances, bias cannot be reduced through adjustment or multilevel regression and post stratification and one has to use weighting. The problem with weighting is that for a fully Bayesian approach, one would like to estimate weights and treatment effects in one model. However, this is due to model coupling impossible. This the begs the question how one could still propagate uncertainty about model weights into the estimation of treatment effects. As far as I know, there are currently no perfect answers to this question. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1613692800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613692800,"objectID":"e143b2b788fa66a2e4df73168cc10e65","permalink":"/project/nfrsea/","publishdate":"2021-02-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/nfrsea/","section":"project","summary":"Estimating effects of special medication and special education on school performance using observational data","tags":["Bayesian","Epidemiology","ADHD"],"title":"Effects of stimulant medication and special education on school performance","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this research line I use epidemiological approaches to learn more about rsik factors for ADHD.\nOne paper in this area examines how self selection into a study and loss to follow up can bias associations between exposures and outcomes, and how one can best reduce this bias. Elaborating on a seminal paper by Hernan and colleagues we point out that one cannot determine if large studies such as for example MoBa, ALSPAC or the UK Biobank are generally \u0026ldquo;representative\u0026rdquo;. Instead the relationship between specific variables of interest in a study and variables that predict (continued) participation determine if bias is likely and how it should be accounted for. Importantly: When mental health related outcomes like ADHD, depression, etc. are involved, simply adjusting for participation predictors will often increase and not decrease bias. In comparison, inverse probability of participation weights will reduce bias. The reason is that participation predictors are often colliders between (mental health) outcomes and exposures, and conditioning on colliders introduces bias, but weighting does not.\nIn other research colleagues and I investigate associations between maternal characteristics, often assessed in pregnancy, and developmental outcomes including ADHD. Differently than some research in this field, we use Bayesian hierarchical1 regression models to estimate associations, which allows us to deal effectively with the multiple comparison problem, and we focus on effect sizes as opposed to statistical significance (using MoBa, our sample size is often in the tens of thousands). So far, our findings indicate that in rich industrialized countries the association between maternal nutrition or exposure to toxicants and child developmental outcomes are so small that they are unlikely to be practically sigfnificant.\n  I think more researchers could be aware that by Stein\u0026rsquo;s Paradox estimates for sub-groups from a hierarchical regression expected to be more accurate than estimates from separate analyses of sub-groups.

When such models are reasonably complex, Bayesian estimation more reliably estimates model parameters than alternative approaches. Just as importantly, Bayesian estimation as for example done in Stan also signals when model parameters cannot be estimated reliably.\nIn epidemiological research with very large data set effect sizes matter, because practically irrelvant effect sizes can reach statistical significance.

To deal with this and other biases, one can use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to represent the (assumed) causal structure that generates the data we observe and to determine the best ways to deal with potential biases. Depending on the causal structure, adjustment, multilevel regression and post stratification, weighting or a combination of these approaches can be useful. I am also planning to explore methods often used in econometrics, like Difference in Differences or regression discontinuity, though it is uncertain that there exist data in Norway that would allow to estimate average treatment effects.\nThe goal of this research is to provide estimates of causal effects, even if we know that these will always be imperfect. Our approach is to reduce this imperfection as much as we can, and to be transparent about the remaining uncertainties like unobserved confounders when we describe results.\n","date":1613347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613347200,"objectID":"e04a27dd0d17d0a8464f7a63f5d4a42f","permalink":"/project/causalinf/","publishdate":"2021-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/causalinf/","section":"project","summary":"Estimating treatment effects from observational data","tags":["Epidemiology","ADHD","Causality"],"title":"Causal inference from observational data","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My research career started in the Centre for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin.

In hindsight it is not surprising that reciprocity explained behavior better.

Prenatal phthalate exposure has been linked with altered neurodevelopment, including externalizing behaviors and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the implicated metabolite, neurobehavioral endpoint, and child sex have not always been consistent across studies, possibly due to heterogeneity in neurodevelopmental instruments. The complex set of findings may be synthesized using executive function (EF), a construct of complex cognitive processes that facilitate ongoing goal-directed behaviors. Impaired EF can be presented with various phenotypes of poor neurodevelopment, differently across structured conditions, home/community, or preschool/school. We evaluated the relationship between prenatal phthalate exposure and comprehensive assessment of preschool EF. METHODS. Our study comprised 262 children with clinically significant/subthreshold ADHD symptoms and 78 typically developing children who were born between 2003 and 2008 and participated in the Preschool ADHD Substudy, which is nested within a population-based prospective cohort study, the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort (MoBa). Twelve phthalate metabolites were measured from urine samples that their mothers had provided during pregnancy, at 17 weeks' gestation. All children, at approximately 3.5-years, took part in a detailed clinical assessment that included parent-and teacher-rated inventories and administered tests. We used instruments that measured constructs related to EF, which include a parent-and teacher-reported Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool (BRIEF-P) and three performance-based tests. A Developmental NEuroPSYchological Assessment (NEPSY), Stanford-Binet intelligence test V (SB5), and the cookie delay task (CDT). The standard deviation change in test score per interquartile range (IQR) increase in phthalate metabolite was estimated with multivariable linear regression. We applied weighting in all models to account for the oversampling of children with clinically significant or subthreshold symptoms of ADHD. Additionally, we assessed modification by child sex and potential co-pollutant confounding. RESULTS. Elevated exposure to mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) during pregnancy was associated with poorer EF, across all domains and instruments, in both sex. For example, an IQR increase in MBzP was associated with poorer working memory rated by parent (1.23 [95% CI. 0.20, 2.26]) and teacher (1.13 [0.14, 2.13]) using BRIEF-P, and administered tests such as SB5 (no-verbal. 0.19 [0.09, 0.28]; verbal. 0.13 [0.01, 0.25]). Adverse associations were also observed for mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) and mono-iso-butyl phthalate (MiBP), although results varied by instruments. EF domains reported by parents using BRIEF-P were most apparently implicated, with stronger associations among boys (e.g., MnBP and inhibition. 2.74 [1.77, 3.72]; MiBP and inhibition. 1.88 [0.84, 2.92]) than among girls (e.g., MnBP and inhibition. -0.63 [-2.08, 0.83], interaction p-value. 0.04; MiBP and inhibition. -0.15 [-1.04, 0.74], interaction p-value. 0.3). Differences by sex, however, were not found for the teacher-rated BRIEF-P or administered tests including NEPSY, SB5, and CDT. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE. Elevated mid-pregnancy MBzP, MiBP, and MnBP were associated with more adverse profiles of EF among preschool-aged children across a range of instruments and raters, with some associations found only among boys. Given our findings and accumulating evidence of the prenatal period as a critical window for phthalate exposure, there is a timely need to expand the current phthalate regulations focused on baby products to include pregnancy exposures.","tags":["Epidemiology","ADHD","RiskFactors"],"title":"Prenatal phthalate exposures and executive function in preschool children","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guido Biele","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Viral load, as measured by RT-PCR, can inform considerations regarding transmission, especially if existing knowledge of viral load in other respiratory diseases is taken into account. RT-PCR threshold cycle data from 3303 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (out of 77,996 persons tested in total, drawn from across Germany) were analysed to examine the relationship between patient age and estimated viral load. Two PCR systems were used. In data from the PCR system predominantly used for community and cluster screening during the early phase of the epidemic (Roche LightCycler 480 II), when such screening was frequent practice, viral loads do not differ significantly in three comparisons between young and old age groups (differences in log10 viral loads between young and old estimated from raw viral load data and a Bayesian mixture model of gamma distributions collectively range between -0.11 and -0.43). Data from a second type of PCR system (Roche cobas 6800/8800), introduced into diagnostic testing on March 16, 2020 and used during the time when household and other contact testing was reduced, show a credible but small difference in the three comparisons between young and old age groups (differences, measured as above, collectively range between -0.43 and -0.83). This small difference may be due to differential patterns of PCR instrument utilization rather than to an actual difference in viral load. Considering household transmission data on influenza, which has a similar viral load kinetic to SARS-CoV-2, the viral load differences between age groups observed in this study are likely to be of limited relevance. Combined data from both PCR instruments show that viral loads of at least 250,000 copies, a threshold we previously established for the isolation of infectious virus in cell culture at more than 5% probability, were present across the study period in 29.0% of kindergarten-aged patients 0-6 years old (n=38), 37.3% of those aged 0-19 (n=150), and in 51.4% of those aged 20 and above (n=3153). The differences in these fractions may also be due to differences in test utilization. We conclude that a considerable percentage of infected people in all age groups, including those who are pre- or mild-symptomatic, carry viral loads likely to represent infectivity. Based on these results and uncertainty about the remaining incidence, we recommend caution and careful monitoring during gradual lifting of non-pharmaceutical interventions. In particular, there is little evidence from the present study to support suggestions that children may not be as infectious as adults.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWork at Charit{'e} virology is funded by European Commission via project ReCoVer, the German Ministry of Research and Education via Deutsches Zentrum f{\"u}r Infektionsforschung, and the German Ministry of Health via the Konsiliarlabor f{\"u}r Coronaviren.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below.Charit{'e} ethics committeeAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent organic pollutants that are suspected to be neurodevelopmental toxicants, but epidemiological evidence on neurodevelopmental effects of PFAS exposure is inconsistent. We investigated the associations between prenatal exposure to PFASs and symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and cognitive functioning (language skills, estimated IQ and working memory) in preschool children, as well as effect modification by child sex. MATERIAL AND METHODS. This study included 944 mother-child pairs enrolled in a longitudinal prospective study of ADHD symptoms (the ADHD Study), with participants recruited from The Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Boys and girls aged three and a half years, participated in extensive clinical assessments using well-validated tools; The Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment interview, Child Development Inventory and Stanford-Binet (5th revision). Prenatal levels of 19 PFASs were measured in maternal blood at week 17 of gestation. Multivariable adjusted regression models were used to examine exposure-outcome associations with two principal components extracted from the seven detected PFASs. Based on these results, we performed regression analyses of individual PFASs categorized into quintiles. RESULTS. PFAS component 1 was mainly explained by perfluoroheptane sulfonate (PFHpS), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). PFAS component 2 was mainly explained by perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Regression models showed a negative association between PFAS component 1 and nonverbal working memory [$beta$ = -0.08 (CI. -0.12, -0.03)] and a positive association between PFAS component 2 and verbal working memory [$beta$ = 0.07 (CI. 0.01, 0.12)]. There were no associations with ADHD symptoms, language skills or IQ. For verbal working memory and PFAS component 2, we found evidence for effect modification by child sex, with associations only for boys. The results of quintile models with individual PFASs, showed the same pattern for working memory as the results in the component regression analyses. There were negative associations between nonverbal working memory and quintiles of PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS, PFHpS and PFOS and positive associations between verbal working memory and quintiles of PFOA, PFNA, PFDA and PFUnDA, with significant relationships mainly in the highest concentration groups. CONCLUSIONS. Based on our results, we did not find consistent evidence to conclude that prenatal exposure to PFASs are associated with ADHD symptoms or cognitive dysfunctions in preschool children aged three and a half years, which is in line with the majority of studies in this area. Our results showed some associations between PFASs and working memory, particularly negative relationships with nonverbal working memory, but also positive relationships with verbal working memory. The relationships were weak, as well as both positive and negative, which suggest no clear association - and need for replication.","tags":["Epidemiology","ADHD","RiskFactors"],"title":"Prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances and associations with symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and cognitive functions in preschool children","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tiril Cecilie Borge","Anne Lise Brantsæter","Ida Henriette Caspersen","Helle Margrete Meltzer","Ragnhild Eek Brandlistuen","Heidi Aase","Guido Biele"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"281ee5dfa02d15211c7c84b0bd5f82f1","permalink":"/publication/pub_2019a/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pub_2019a/","section":"publication","summary":"Our aim in this study was to estimate the strength of associations between prenatal diet quality and child behavioral, language, and motor functions in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (1999-2008).

In total, 27,529 mother-child pairs were eligible for inclusion. A 1-standard-deviation increase in PDQI score was associated with an absolute reduction in outcome sum scores of 0.02-0.21 and a 3%-7% relative decrease, with larger decreases seen for language and motor functions than for behavioral functions. PDQI scores were inversely associated with all child functions, but the estimated strength of each association was low.

Previous investigations illustrated that such biases can be small in large prospective cohort studies. The structural approach to selection bias shows that general statements about bias are not possible for studies that investigate multiple exposures and outcomes, and that inverse probability of participation weighting (IPPW) but not adjustment for participation predictors generally reduces bias from self-selection and loss to follow-up. We propose to substantiate assumptions in structural models of selection bias through calculation of genetic correlations coefficients between participation predictors, outcome, and exposure, and to estimate a lower bound for bias due to self-selection and loss to follow-up by comparing effect estimates from IPP weighted and unweighted analyses. This study used data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study and the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Using the example of risk factors for ADHD, we find that genetic correlations between participation predictors, exposures, and outcome suggest the presence of bias. The comparison of exposure-outcome associations from regressions with and without IPPW revealed meaningful deviations. Assessment of selection bias for entire multi-exposure multi-outcome cohort studies is not possible. Instead, it has to be assessed and controlled on a case-by-case basis.","tags":["Epidemiology","ADHD","Causality"],"title":"Bias from self selection and loss to follow-up in prospective cohort studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

There have been few studies of the screening properties of these subscales, particularly outside the United States. We investigated the classification accuracy of the parent and teacher versions of the HI and IA subscales and the cross-cultural validity of the cutoff values based on norms from a United States sample. The present study was part of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Parents and teachers rated boys (n = 332) and girls (n = 319) with the ECI-4 (mean Age 3.5 years). Interviewers who were blind to the ratings used the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment Interview to assign ADHD diagnoses. The ECI-4 HI and IA subscales showed acceptable accuracy in identifying ADHD in boys and girls (areas under the curve ranged from .67 to .85). In a multivariate regression analysis, the parent and teacher HI subscale scores significantly contributed to ADHD identification, but not the IA subscale scores. To achieve the necessary sensitivity to detect children with ADHD, lower cutoff levels than those specified by the United States ECI-4 norms were needed. For screening purposes, the parent and teacher ECI-4 showed acceptable accuracy in identifying preschoolers at risk for ADHD, and it may be sufficient to use the HI subscale scores. The suggested cutoff values provided by the United States ECI-4 norms had limited cross-cultural validity.

Hyperkinetic disorder is one of the most frequently used psychiatric diagnoses among children and adolescents in Norway. It has previously been shown that use of the diagnosis varies widely by county. MATERIAL AND METHOD. We estimated the proportion of children with hyperkinetic disorder using patient data from the Norwegian Patient Registry and population data from the Norwegian Population Registry. The estimations were made for both Norway as a whole and by county. Assessment and documentation of the diagnosis were surveyed by linking the Norwegian Patient Registry and the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. We reviewed medical records from specialist mental health services for children and adolescents and assessed whether the diagnoses met the research criteria for hyperkinetic disorder. RESULTS. At 12 years of age, 5.4 % of Norwegian boys and 2.1 % of Norwegian girls had been diagnosed with hyperkinetic disorder by specialist health services. The proportion of children varied between 1.4 % and 5.5 % among the counties. A review of medical records for 549 children showed that 49 % of the diagnoses were reliably documented in the records. The main reasons that the diagnosis was not documented were a discrepancy between the information in the medical record and diagnostic criteria (38 %) and inadequate differential diagnostic assessment (46 %). INTERPRETATION. There was considerable geographic variation in the proportions of children and adolescents with hyperkinetic disorder. A large percentage of the diagnoses were not reliably documented in medical records. The guideline for evaluation, diagnostics and medical recordkeeping should be reviewed.","tags":["Epidemiology","ADHD"],"title":"Diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorder among children in Norway","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kristin Romvig Øvergaard","Beate Oerbeck","Svein Friis","Are Hugo Pripp","Guido Biele","Heidi Aase","Paal Zeiner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527811200,"objectID":"3f9409ceae3851e1b017b2f8a6e1cf62","permalink":"/publication/pub_2018c/","publishdate":"2018-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pub_2018c/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVE. Although early and accurate screening is required for the remediation of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), possible gender differences have not been extensively studied. We examined the classification accuracy of the parent and preschool teacher version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) hyperactivity-inattention (HI) subscale in girls and boys. METHOD. The study was part of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Parents and preschool teachers rated a total of 238 girls and 276 boys (mean age 3.5 years) with the SDQ HI subscale. Blinded to the parent and teacher ratings, interviewers classified the children by ADHD diagnoses with the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment Interview. RESULTS. Areas under the curves for the parent HI subscale scores were good for both girls and boys (0.87 and 0.80, respectively). Preschool teacher classifications were fair (0.76) for girls and poor (0.62) for boys, a significant difference (p = .017). The subscale accurately identified children without ADHD at low parent scores ($leq$4), and fairly accurately identified ADHD at high scores ($geq$9), with maximum probabilities of finding true cases of 0.75 in girls and 0.55 in boys. Intermediate scores gave the best balance between sensitivity and specificity with low probabilities of correctly identifying children with ADHD. CONCLUSION. The parental SDQ HI subscale was useful for screening for ADHD in preschool girls and boys. For preschool teachers, the subscale was useful for screening girls.","tags":["Epidemiology","ADHD"],"title":"Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Preschoolers.

Thalamic dysfunction is a classical finding in schizophrenia (SZ), and resting-state functional MRI has implicated somatomotor and frontal lobe thalamic dysconnectivity. However, it remains unclear whether these findings generalize to different psychotic disorders, are confined to specific thalamic sub-regions, and how they relate to structural thalamic alterations. Within-thalamic and thalamo-cortical functional connectivity was assessed using resting-state functional MRI data obtained from patients with SZ (n = 96), bipolar disorder (BD, n = 57), and healthy controls (HC, n = 280). Further, we used thalamic sub-regions as seeds to investigate specific cortical connectivity patterns, and performed structural analyses of thalamic volume and shape. Results showed reduced within-thalamic connectivity and thalamo-frontoparietal coupling in SZ and increased thalamo-somatomotor connectivity in BD. One thalamic sub-region showed increased sensory connectivity in SZ and eight sub-regions showed reductions with frontal and posterior areas. Reduced gray matter and shape abnormalities were found in frontal-projecting regions in both SZ and BD, but did not seem to explain reduced functional connectivity. Aberrant thalamo-cortical connectivity patterns in SZ and BD supports the notion of the thalamus as a key structure in the functional connectome across the psychosis spectrum, and the frontal and somatomotor anatomical distribution is in line with the characteristic cognitive and perceptual symptoms in psychotic disorders.","tags":["Neuroscience"],"title":"Thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tiril Cecilie Borge","Heidi Aase","Anne Lise Brantsæter","Guido Biele"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"fbd73098105a45690bb8b63d462c54a3","permalink":"/publication/pub_2017b/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pub_2017b/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVES.

RESULTS. 18 relevant studies, comprising 63 861 participants were identified. The results indicated a small positive association between better maternal diet quality during pregnancy and child functioning. We observed publication bias and significant heterogeneity between studies, where type of diet classification, publication year and outcome domain together accounted for about 30% of this heterogeneity. Trim and fill analysis substantiated the presence of publication bias for studies in the affective domain and showed an adjusted effect size of Hedge's g=0.088 (p=0.0018) (unadjusted g=0.093 (p=0.03)).

In rodents, the $mu$-opioid receptor (MOR) system encodes motivation and preference for high-value rewards. Yet it remains unclear whether and how human MORs contribute to value-based decision-making. We reasoned that if the human MOR system modulates value-based choice, this would be reflected by opposite effects of agonist and antagonist drugs. In a double-blind pharmacological cross-over study, 30 healthy men received morphine (10 mg), placebo, and the opioid antagonist naltrexone (50 mg). They completed a two-alternative decision-making task known to induce a considerable bias towards the most frequently rewarded response option. To quantify MOR involvement in this bias, we fitted accuracy and reaction time data with the drift--diffusion model (DDM) of decision-making. The DDM analysis revealed the expected bidirectional drug effects for two decision subprocesses. MOR stimulation with morphine increased the preference for the stimulus with high-reward probability (shift in starting point). Compared to placebo, morphine also increased, and naltrexone reduced, the efficiency of evidence accumulation. Since neither drug affected motor-coordination, speed-accuracy trade-off, or subjective state (indeed participants were still blinded after the third session), we interpret the MOR effects on evidence accumulation efficiency as a consequence of changes in effort exerted in the task. Together, these findings support a role for the human MOR system in value-based choice by tuning decision-making towards high-value rewards across stimulus domains.","tags":["DecisionMaking","Modelling"],"title":"Opioid Modulation of Value-Based Decision-Making in Healthy Humans","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mads Lund Pedersen","Michael J Frank","Guido Biele"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1501545600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1501545600,"objectID":"95f21298153cfbc1a723db0a7593aa9b","permalink":"/publication/pub_2017a/","publishdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pub_2017a/","section":"publication","summary":"Current reinforcement-learning models often assume simplified decision processes that do not fully reflect the dynamic complexities of choice processes. Conversely, sequential-sampling models of decision making account for both choice accuracy and response time, but assume that decisions are based on static decision values. To combine these two computational models of decision making and learning, we implemented reinforcement-learning models in which the drift diffusion model describes the choice process, thereby capturing both within- and across-trial dynamics. To exemplify the utility of this approach, we quantitatively fit data from a common reinforcement-learning paradigm using hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation, and compared model variants to determine whether they could capture the effects of stimulant medication in adult patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over clinical trial of MPH (clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01831622) explored large-scale brain network dynamics in 20 adults with ADHD on and off MPH, compared to 27 healthy controls, while performing a reward based decision-making task. DMN task-related activation, variability, and connectivity were estimated and compared between groups and conditions using independent component analysis, dual regression, and Bayesian linear mixed models. The results show that the DMN exhibited more variable activation patterns in unmedicated patients compared to healthy controls. Group differences in functional connectivity both between and within functional networks were evident. Further, functional connectivity between and within attention and DMN networks was sensitive both to task performance and case-control status. MPH altered within-network connectivity of the DMN and visual networks, but not between-network connectivity or temporal variability. This study thus provides novel fMRI evidence of reduced sustained DMN suppression in adults with ADHD during value-based decision-making, a pattern that was not alleviated by MPH. We infer from multiple analytical approaches further support to the default mode interference hypothesis, in that higher DMN activation variability is evident in adult ADHD and associated with lower task performance.","tags":["DecisionMaking","Neuroscience","ADHD","Bayesian"],"title":"Increased default-mode variability is related to reduced task-performance and is evident in adults with ADHD","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sigurd Ziegler","Mads Lund Pedersen","Athanasia M Mowinckel","Guido Biele"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1480550400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1480550400,"objectID":"778e7ca05573009c3824c511d2335626","permalink":"/publication/pub_2016a/","publishdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pub_2016a/","section":"publication","summary":"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterized by altered Decision-making (DM) and reinforcement learning (RL), for which competing theories propose alternative explanations.

Whether the potential detrimental effects of dioxins and PCBs on neurodevelopment are of specific or unspecific character is not clear. OBJECTIVES. The purpose of the current study was to examine the influence of maternal dietary exposure to dioxins and PCBs on ADHD symptoms and cognitive functioning in preschoolers. We aimed to investigate a range of functions, in particular IQ, expressive language, and executive functions. MATERIAL AND METHODS. This study includes n=1024 children enrolled in a longitudinal prospective study of ADHD (the ADHD Study), with participants recruited from The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Boys and girls aged 3.5years participated in extensive clinical assessments using well-validated tools; The Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment interview (PAPA), Stanford-Binet 5th revision (SB-5), Child Development Inventory (CDI), and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Preschool version (BRIEF-P). Maternal dietary exposure to dioxins and PCBs was estimated based on a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) answered mid-pregnancy and a database of dioxin and PCB concentrations in Norwegian foods. Exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs (dl-compounds) was expressed in total toxic equivalents (TEQ), and PCB-153 was used as marker for non-dioxin-like PCBs (ndl-PCBs). Generalized linear and additive models adjusted for confounders were used to examine exposure-outcome associations. RESULTS. Exposure to PCB-153 or dl-compound was not significantly associated with any of the outcome measures when analyses were performed for boys and girls together. After stratifying by sex, adjusted analyses indicated a small inverse association with language in girls. An increase in the exposure variables of 1 SD was associated with a reduction in language score of -0.2 [CI -0.4, -0.1] for PCB-153 and -0.2 [CI -0.5, -0.1] for dl-compounds in girls. For boys, exposure to PCB-153 or dl-compounds was not associated with language skills. The difference between sex-specific associations was not statistically significant (p-value=0.13). No sex-specific effects were observed for ADHD-symptoms, IQ scores, or executive functions. CONCLUSIONS. We found no indications that variation in current low-level exposure to PCB-153 or dl-compounds in Norway is associated with variation ADHD-symptoms, verbal/non-verbal IQ, or executive functions including working memory in preschoolers. However, our findings indicated that maternal dietary exposure to PCB-153 or dl-compounds during pregnancy was significantly associated with poorer expressive language skills in preschool girls, although the sex-specific associations were not significantly different.","tags":["Epidemiology","ADHD","RiskFactors"],"title":"The influence of maternal dietary exposure to dioxins and PCBs during pregnancy on ADHD symptoms and cognitive functions in Norwegian preschool children","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nathan Berg","Guido Biele","Gerd Gigerenzer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1467331200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1467331200,"objectID":"ea7cca5851a2ede3df257b1ccc29d4e7","permalink":"/publication/pub_2016d/","publishdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pub_2016d/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper looks for, but cannot find, evidence that links belief inconsistency to belief inaccuracy or economic loss.

The human brain is organized into functionally distinct modules of which interactions constitute the human functional connectome. Accumulating evidence has implicated perturbations in the patterns of brain connectivity across a range of neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders, but little is known about diagnostic specificity. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders are severe mental disorders with partly overlapping symptomatology. Neuroimaging has demonstrated brain network disintegration in the pathophysiologies; however, to which degree the 2 diagnoses present with overlapping abnormalities remains unclear. METHODS. We collected resting-state fMRI data from patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and from healthy controls. Aiming to characterize connectivity differences across 2 severe mental disorders, we derived global functional connectivity using eigenvector centrality mapping, which allows for regional inference of centrality or importance in the brain network. RESULTS. Seventy-one patients with schizophrenia, 43 with bipolar disorder and 196 healthy controls participated in our study. We found significant effects of diagnosis in 12 clusters, where pairwise comparisons showed decreased global connectivity in high-centrality clusters. sensory regions in patients with schizophrenia and subcortical regions in both patient groups. Increased connectivity occurred in frontal and parietal clusters in patients with schizophrenia, with intermediate effects in those with bipolar disorder. Patient groups differed in most cortical clusters, with the strongest effects in sensory regions. LIMITATIONS. Methodological concerns of in-scanner motion and the use of full correlation measures may make analyses more vulnerable to noise. CONCLUSION. Our results show decreased eigenvector centrality of limbic structures in both patient groups and in sensory regions in patients with schizophrenia as well as increased centrality in frontal and parietal regions in both groups, with stronger effects in patients with schizophrenia.","tags":["Neuroscience"],"title":"Global brain connectivity alterations in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar spectrum disorders","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ragnhild Ørstavik","Kristin Gustavson","Nina Rohrer-Baumgartner","Guido Biele","Kari Furu","Øystein Karlstad","Ted Reichborn-Kjennerud","Tiril Borge","Heidi Aase"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"d082d177a2d5a533fdb16e6b203673ed","permalink":"/publication/pub_2016c/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pub_2016c/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["ADHD"],"title":"ADHD i Norge.

Numerous investigations from psychology, economics, and neuroscience have produced evidence consistent with this notion. However, this research has typically investigated choices involving relatively affect-poor, monetary outcomes. We compared choice in relatively affect-poor, monetary lottery problems with choice in relatively affect-rich medical decision problems. Computational modeling of behavioral data and model-based neuroimaging analyses provide converging evidence for substantial differences in the respective decision mechanisms. Relative to affect-poor choices, affect-rich choices yielded a more strongly curved probability weighting function of cumulative prospect theory, thus signaling that the psychological impact of probabilities is strongly diminished for affect-rich outcomes. Examining task-dependent brain activation, we identified a region-by-condition interaction indicating qualitative differences of activation between affect-rich and affect-poor choices. Moreover, brain activation in regions that were more active during affect-poor choices (e.g., the supramarginal gyrus) correlated with individual trial-by-trial decision weights, indicating that these regions reflect processing of probabilities. Formal reverse inference Neurosynth meta-analyses suggested that whereas affect-poor choices seem to be based on brain mechanisms for calculative processes, affect-rich choices are driven by the representation of outcomes' emotional value and autobiographical memories associated with them. These results provide evidence that the traditional notion of expectation maximization may not apply in the context of outcomes laden with affective responses, and that understanding the brain mechanisms of decision making requires the domain of the decision to be taken into account.","tags":["DecisionMaking","Neuroscience","Modelling"],"title":"The neural basis of risky choice with affective outcomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guido Biele","Paal Zeiner","Heidi Aase"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1417392000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1417392000,"objectID":"01a791c4b6ef5295e322470713b28b10","permalink":"/publication/pub_2014a/","publishdate":"2014-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pub_2014a/","section":"publication","summary":"Epidemiological studies often use parent questionnaires to assess children's development and mental health.

Extant theories and evidence suggest that dopaminergic modulation plays a crucial role in reinforcement learning and the updating of choice - outcome expectations. Furthermore, recently a positive component of the event-related potential about 200 ms (P2) after feedback has been suggested to reflect such updating. The efficacy of dopaminergic modulation changes across the life span. However, to date investigations of age-related differences in feedback-related P2 during reinforcement learning are still scarce. The present study thus aims to investigate whether individual differences in the feedback-related P2 would be associated with polymorphic variations in a dopamine relevant gene PPP1R1B (also known as DARPP-32) and whether the genetic effect may differ between age groups. We observed larger P2 amplitudes in individuals carrying the genotype associated with higher dopamine receptor efficacy, i.e., a allele homozygotes of a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs907094) of the PPP1R1B gene. Moreover, this effect was more pronounced in children and older adults in comparison to adolescents and younger adults. Together, our findings indicate that polymorphic variations in a dopamine relevant gene are associated with individual differences in brain-evoked potentials of outcome updating and hint at the possibility that genotype effects on neurocognitive phenotypes may vary as a function of brain maturation and aging.","tags":["DecisionMaking","Neuroscience"],"title":"Effects of PPP1R1B (DARPP-32) Polymorphism on Feedback-Related Brain Potentials Across the Life Span","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siri Leknes","Chantal Berna","Michael C Lee","Gregory D Snyder","Guido Biele","Irene Tracey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1362096000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1362096000,"objectID":"a86ff9f5ffd2dfa8da3cd08ad49f5f1c","permalink":"/publication/pub_2013a/","publishdate":"2013-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pub_2013a/","section":"publication","summary":"Context can influence the experience of any event. For instance, the thought that ``it could be worse'' can improve feelings towards a present misfortune. In this study we measured hedonic feelings, skin conductance, and brain activation patterns in 16 healthy volunteers who experienced moderate pain in two different contexts. In the ``relative relief context,'' moderate pain represented the best outcome, since the alternative outcome was intense pain. However, in the control context, moderate pain represented the worst outcome and elicited negative hedonic feelings. The context manipulation resulted in a ``hedonic flip,'' such that moderate pain elicited positive hedonics in the relative relief context. Somewhat surprisingly, moderate pain was even rated as pleasant in this context, despite being reported as painful in the control context. This ``hedonic flip'' was corroborated by physiological and functional neuroimaging data. When moderate pain was perceived as pleasant, skin conductance and activity in insula and dorsal anterior cingulate were significantly attenuated relative to the control moderate stimulus. ``Pleasant pain'' also increased activity in reward and valuation circuitry, including the medial orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortices. Furthermore, the change in outcome hedonics correlated with activity in the periacqueductal grey (PAG) of the descending pain modulatory system (DPMS). The context manipulation also significantly increased functional connectivity between reward circuitry and the PAG, consistent with a functional change of the DPMS due to the altered motivational state.

Using multivariate linear discriminant analysis of the EEG, we identified multiple punishment-induced discriminating components with spatially distinct scalp topographies.

Decision making thus requires effectively managing the amount of accumulated evidence versus the amount of available time. Importantly, the neural substrate of this decision threshold modulation is unknown. Participants performed a perceptual decision-making task in blocks with identical duration but different reward schedules. Behavioral and modeling results indicate that human subjects modulated their decision threshold to maximize net reward. Neuroimaging results indicate that decision threshold modulation was achieved by adjusting effective connectivity within corticostriatal and cerebellar-striatal brain systems, the former being responsible for processing of accumulated sensory evidence and the latter being responsible for automatic, subsecond temporal processing.

One-time advice received before learning had a sustained influence on people's learning processes. This was best explained by social learning mechanisms implementing a more positive evaluation of the outcomes from recommended options. Computer simulations showed that this ``outcome-bonus'' accumulates more rewards than an alternative mechanism implementing higher initial reward expectation for recommended options. fMRI results revealed a neural outcome-bonus signal in the septal area and the left caudate. This neural signal coded rewards in the absence of advice, and crucially, it signaled greater positive rewards for positive and negative feedback after recommended rather than after non-recommended choices. Hence, our results indicate that following advice is intrinsically rewarding.

In sum, we show that a neurophysiological mechanism previously established for perceptual decision making, that is, the difference-based accumulation of evidence, is fundamental also in value-based decisions. The brain, thus, weighs costs against benefits by combining neural benefit and cost signals into a single, difference-based neural representation of net value, which is accumulated over time until the individual decides to accept or reject an option.","tags":["DecisionMaking","Neuroscience"],"title":"How the brain integrates costs and benefits during decision making","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Susanne Graef","Guido Biele","Lea K Krugel","Frank Marzinzik","Michael Wahl","Johann Wotka","Fabian Klostermann","Hauke R Heekeren"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1285891200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1285891200,"objectID":"f35626113d6dcd1600d810984e81264c","permalink":"/publication/pub_2010e/","publishdate":"2010-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pub_2010e/","section":"publication","summary":"The mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system linking the dopaminergic midbrain to the prefrontal cortex and subcortical striatum has been shown to be sensitive to reinforcement in animals and humans. Within this system, coexistent segregated striato-frontal circuits have been linked to different functions. In the present study, we tested patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic cell loss, on two reward-based learning tasks assumed to differentially involve dorsal and ventral striato-frontal circuits. 15 non-depressed and non-demented PD patients on levodopa monotherapy were tested both on and off medication. Levodopa had beneficial effects on the performance on an instrumental learning task with constant stimulus-reward associations, hypothesized to rely on dorsal striato-frontal circuits. In contrast, performance on a reversal learning task with changing reward contingencies, relying on ventral striato-frontal structures, was better in the unmedicated state. These results are in line with the ``overdose hypothesis'' which assumes detrimental effects of dopaminergic medication on functions relying upon less affected regions in PD. This study demonstrates, in a within-subject design, a double dissociation of dopaminergic medication and performance on two reward-based learning tasks differing in regard to whether reward contingencies are constant or dynamic. There was no evidence for a dose effect of levodopa on reward-based behavior with the patients' actual levodopa dose being uncorrelated to their performance on the reward-based learning tasks.","tags":["DecisionMaking","Neuroscience"],"title":"Differential influence of levodopa on reward-based learning in Parkinson's disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marios G Philiastides","Guido Biele","Niki Vavatzanidis","Philipp Kazzer","Hauke R Heekeren"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1285891200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1285891200,"objectID":"75a78db63e34b132196cedfed4586517","permalink":"/publication/pub_2010d/","publishdate":"2010-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pub_2010d/","section":"publication","summary":"Adaptive decision making depends on the accurate representation of rewards associated with potential choices. These representations can be acquired with reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms, which use the prediction error (PE, the difference between expected and received rewards) as a learning signal to update reward expectations. While EEG experiments have highlighted the role of feedback-related potentials during performance monitoring, important questions about the temporal sequence of feedback processing and the specific function of feedback-related potentials during reward-based decision making remain. Here, we hypothesized that feedback processing starts with a qualitative evaluation of outcome-valence, which is subsequently complemented by a quantitative representation of PE magnitude. Results of a model-based single-trial analysis of EEG data collected during a reversal learning task showed that around 220ms after feedback outcomes are initially evaluated categorically with respect to their valence (positive vs. negative). Around 300ms, and parallel to the maintained valence-evaluation, the brain also represents quantitative information about PE magnitude, thus providing the complete information needed to update reward expectations and to guide adaptive decision making. Importantly, our single-trial EEG analysis based on PEs from an RL model showed that the feedback-related potentials do not merely reflect error awareness, but rather quantitative information crucial for learning reward contingencies.","tags":["DecisionMaking","Neuroscience","Modelling"],"title":"Temporal dynamics of prediction error processing during reward-based decision making","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marios G Philiastides","Guido Biele","Hauke R Heekeren"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1272672000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1272672000,"objectID":"84e78f7cfc37bb1f77081e168fa4c592","permalink":"/publication/pub_2010c/","publishdate":"2010-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pub_2010c/","section":"publication","summary":"To make decisions based on the value of different options, we often have to combine different sources of probabilistic evidence.

To date, however, little is known about how the brain processes risk. Recent conceptualizations of risky decision making highlight that it is generally associated with emotions but do not specify how emotions are implicated in risk processing. Moreover, little is known about risk processing in non-choice situations and how potential losses influence risk processing. Here we used quantitative meta-analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments on risk processing in the brain to investigate (1) how risk processing is influenced by emotions, (2) how it differs between choice and non-choice situations, and (3) how it changes when losses are possible. By showing that, over a range of experiments and paradigms, risk is consistently represented in the anterior insula, a brain region known to process aversive emotions such as anxiety, disappointment, or regret, we provide evidence that risk processing is influenced by emotions. Furthermore, our results show risk-related activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex in choice situations but not in situations in which no choice is involved or a choice has already been made. The anterior insula was predominantly active in the presence of potential losses, indicating that potential losses modulate risk processing.","tags":["DecisionMaking","Neuroscience"],"title":"Neural processing of risk","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter N C Mohr","Guido Biele","Lea K Krugel","Shu-Chen Li","Hauke R Heekeren"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1264982400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1264982400,"objectID":"c7ae6423d183701d0c3e44392c7260dc","permalink":"/publication/pub_2010a/","publishdate":"2010-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pub_2010a/","section":"publication","summary":"Many decisions people make can be described as decisions under risk. Understanding the mechanisms that drive these decisions is an important goal in decision neuroscience. Two competing classes of risky decision making models have been proposed to describe human behavior, namely utility-based models and risk-return models. Here we used a novel investment decision task that uses streams of (past) returns as stimuli to investigate how consistent the two classes of models are with the neurobiological processes underlying investment decisions (where outcomes usually follow continuous distributions). By showing (a) that risk-return models can explain choices behaviorally and (b) that the components of risk-return models (value, risk, and risk attitude) are represented in the brain during choices, we provide evidence that risk-return models describe the neural processes underlying investment decisions well. Most importantly, the observed correlation between risk and brain activity in the anterior insula during choices supports risk-return models more than utility-based models because risk is an explicit component of risk-return models but not of the utility-based models.","tags":["DecisionMaking","Neuroscience"],"title":"Neural foundations of risk-return trade-off in investment decisions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lea K Krugel","Guido Biele","Peter N C Mohr","Shu-Chen Li","Hauke R Heekeren"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1254355200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1254355200,"objectID":"ac270836039f225ad37a98e6a8781f40","permalink":"/publication/pub_2009c/","publishdate":"2009-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pub_2009c/","section":"publication","summary":"The ability to rapidly and flexibly adapt decisions to available rewards is crucial for survival in dynamic environments. Reward-based decisions are guided by reward expectations that are updated based on prediction errors, and processing of these errors involves dopaminergic neuromodulation in the striatum. To test the hypothesis that the COMT gene Val(158)Met polymorphism leads to interindividual differences in reward-based learning, we used the neuromodulatory role of dopamine in signaling prediction errors. We show a behavioral advantage for the phylogenetically ancestral Val/Val genotype in an instrumental reversal learning task that requires rapid and flexible adaptation of decisions to changing reward contingencies in a dynamic environment. Implementing a reinforcement learning model with a dynamic learning rate to estimate prediction error and learning rate for each trial, we discovered that a higher and more flexible learning rate underlies the advantage of the Val/Val genotype. Model-based fMRI analysis revealed that greater and more differentiated striatal fMRI responses to prediction errors reflect this advantage on the neurobiological level. Learning rate-dependent changes in effective connectivity between the striatum and prefrontal cortex were greater in the Val/Val than Met/Met genotype, suggesting that the advantage results from a downstream effect of the prefrontal cortex that is presumably mediated by differences in dopamine metabolism. These results show a critical role of dopamine in processing the weight a particular prediction error has on the expectation updating for the next decision, thereby providing important insights into neurobiological mechanisms underlying the ability to rapidly and flexibly adapt decisions to changing reward contingencies.","tags":["DecisionMaking","Neuroscience"],"title":"Genetic variation in dopaminergic neuromodulation influences the ability to rapidly and flexibly adapt decisions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guido Biele","Ido Erev","Eyal Ert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1243814400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1243814400,"objectID":"a4d1ec7140340eab30d626b7cb61938c","permalink":"/publication/pub_2009a/","publishdate":"2009-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pub_2009a/","section":"publication","summary":"This research examines decisions from experience in restless bandit problems.

The social learning models described the observed learning processes better than the individual learning model. Of the models tested, the best social learning model assumes that outcomes from recommended options are more positively evaluated than outcomes from nonrecommended options. This model correctly predicted that receivers first adhere to advice, then explore other options, and finally return to the recommended option. The model also predicted accurately that good advice has a stronger impact on learning than bad advice.
