  abstract = {This research examines decisions from experience in restless bandit problems. Two experiments revealed four main effects. (1) Risk neutrality. the typical participant did not learn to become risk averse, a contradiction of the hot stove effect. (2) Sensitivity to the transition probabilities that govern the Markov process. (3) Positive recency. the probability of a risky choice being repeated was higher after a win than after a loss. (4) Inertia. the probability of a risky choice being repeated following a loss was higher than the probability of a risky choice after a safe choice. These results can be described with a simple contingent sampler model, which assumes that choices are made based on small samples of experiences contingent on the current state.},
