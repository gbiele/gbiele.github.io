      <title>ADHD risk factors</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this research line I use epidemiological approaches to learn more about rsik factors for ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One paper in this area examines &lt;a href=&#34;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31451995/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;how self selection into a study and loss to follow up can bias associations between exposures and outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, and how one can best reduce this bias. Elaborating on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15308962/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;seminal paper by Hernan and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; we point out that one cannot determine if large studies such as for example &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fhi.no/en/studies/moba/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MoBa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ALSPAC&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt; are generally &amp;ldquo;representative&amp;rdquo;. Instead the relationship between specific variables of interest in a study and variables that predict (continued) participation determine if bias is likely and how it should be accounted for. Importantly: When mental health related outcomes like ADHD, depression, etc. are involved, simply adjusting for participation predictors will often increase and not decrease bias. In comparison, inverse probability of participation weights will reduce bias. The reason for this is that participation predictors are often colliders between (mental health) outcomes and exposures, and conditioning on colliders introduces bias, but weighting does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other research colleagues and I investigate associations between maternal characteristics, often assessed in pregnancy, and developmental outcomes including ADHD. Differently then some research in this field we use Bayesian hierarchical regression models to estimate associations, which allows us to deal effectively with the multiple comparison problem, and we focus on effect sizes as opposed to statistical significance (using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fhi.no/en/studies/moba/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MoBa&lt;/a&gt;, our sample size is often in the tens of thousands). So far, our findings indicate that in rich industrialized countries the association between maternal nutrition or exposure to toxicants &lt;a href=&#34;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31375821/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;and child developmental outcomes are so small that they are unlikely to be practically sigfnificant.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Causal inference from observational data</title>
      <link>/project/causalinf/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are due to their internal validity considered as the gold standard for causal inference. But RCTs are not always feasible or ethical, for instance if one is interested in long-term effects of treatments. More generally, every investigation of causal effects trades off internal and external validity. Hence, one can argue that observational studies of causal effect, which tend to have higher external validity, have their place independent of the practical or ethical chellanges RCTs can pose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently establishing this research line after being rewarded a grant by the Norwegian Research Council. The thematic focus of this research is on the effect of medication and special education on educational and other outcomes of children with ADHD  .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important challenge when estimating treatment effects is that of non-random selection into treatment or treatment by indication. To deal with bias from this and others we will use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to represent the (assumed) causal structure that generates the data we observe and to determine the best ways to deal with potential biases. Depending on the causal structure, adjustment, multilevel regression and post stratification, weighting or a combination of these approaches can be useful. We will also explore methods often used in econometrics like Difference in Differences or regression discontinuity, though it is uncertain that there is exist data in Norway to estimate such models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this research is to provide estimates of causal effects, even if we know that these are will always be imperfect. Our aim is to reduce this imperfection as much as we can.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Decision neuroscience</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this research line I used and sometimes still use mathematical modelling of decision making and learning, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and EEG to understand how human operant learning and decision making.We also investigate how learning and decision making processes are different in adults with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one paper, colleagues and I used a sequential sampling model of decision making and fMRI to describe how &lt;a href=&#34;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21118983/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;costs and benefits are represented in the brain&lt;/a&gt; during decision making. In a related paper we looked for &lt;a href=&#34;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20439711/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;representations of probabilistic evidence&lt;/a&gt; during reard bases decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also done &lt;a href=&#34;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20510376/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19822738/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; on reinforcement learning in general, and how it is influenced by social learning, leading to the proposal that &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001089&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;following advice can in itself be rewarding&lt;/a&gt;. Some of this work has clear markers of a past time, like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19822738/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;small-sample target-gene study&lt;/a&gt;. This was exciting work at the time, but I would approach this research differently today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, I have used quantitative models of decision making to understand decision making in ADHD. We have published a &lt;a href=&#34;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25477020/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;meta analysis&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27608958/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;theoretical review&lt;/a&gt; which describes how we can use quantitative models of decision making to better understand the development and symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. In an empirical paper we use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27966103/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;drift diffusion model of decision making as a choice model for reinforcement learning&lt;/a&gt; to described the effect of ADHD medication on decision making and operant learning.&lt;/p&gt;
